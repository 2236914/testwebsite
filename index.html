                                    Computer generation describes the unique advancements in computer technology across time. Circuits, which are electrical paths, were created to carry out the counting in 1946. It took the place of the counting gears and other mechanical components seen in earlier computers.
                                    The circuits got smaller and more sophisticated with each successive generation, compared to the circuits of the prior generation. The miniaturization aided in boosting computers' speed, memory, and power. The following list of five computer generations includes:

                                    Computers of the first generation were slow, large, and expensive. 
                                    Vacuum tubes served as the foundational elements of the CPU and memory 
                                    in these computers. These computers were mostly dependent on punch cards
                                     and batch operating systems. Magnetic tape and paper tape were utilized as
                                      output and input devices in this generation. Several of the well-known

                                    Transistor computers were faster than first-generation computers
                                     because they used cheaper, more energy-efficient, and smaller transistors.
                                     Magnetic cores were employed as the primary memory in this generation, 
                                     with magnetic discs and tapes serving as the secondary storage.
                                      These computers used batch processing, multiprogramming operating systems, 
                                      assembly language, and programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN.

            one of the oldest programming languages still in use today

             ATMs, phone and cell calls, hospital signals, and 
             traffic signal systems is called Common Business
              Oriented Language (COBOL). Dr. Grace Murray Hopper
               oversaw the language's creation, and it was created
                to be compatible with all makes and models of computers. 
                The main applications of COBOL today are gamification 
                and banking systems.

        Dennis Ritchie created the software at the Bell Telephone 
        Laboratories for the Unix operating system. Because it was
         based on an earlier language called "B," it was given the
          name "C." Many of the most popular languages used today,
           including C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python,
            are derivations of C.

        <b>1972: SQL (SEQUEL at the time)</b> - 
        Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlain, two IBM researchers,
         created SQL for the first time. Information saved in
          databases can be viewed and modified using 
          SEQUEL.
           Structured Query Language, or SQL, is the name of the

            functions, and templates. Since 1986, it has consistently 
            ranked in the top 10 programming languages, and in 2003,
             it was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Game engines, Adobe
